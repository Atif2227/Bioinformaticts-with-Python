Bioinformaticts-with-Python
This is a single Jupyter file which has a the function separately for all the different events of Central Dogma.
It starts with generating random DNA string, validating it as correct DNA string, transcription, reverse transcription, generating a double stranded DNA, finding GC content of DNA string and subsection of DNA string, translation of mRNA into amino acid sequence, calculating frequency/proportion of a particular amino acid from the amino acid sequence, generating 6 reading frames, extracting all possible protein from a given aminoacid sequence, extracting all possible proteins from the 6 reading frames.
These set of codes could be compiled in a class for easy usage and it can be used as a base for making any GUI for performing such tasks.
Possibilities are endless and there is always a chance of improvement.

1. central_dogma_toolkit - it has all the functions for different events of central dogma.
2. main - it has all the print commands.
3. structures - it has all the structures of nucleotides and aminoacids.
4. utilities - it has come uutilities codes.
