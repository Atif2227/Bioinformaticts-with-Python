The set of codes written below performs each step involved in 'Central Dogma'. It starts with generating random DNA string, validating it as correct DNA string, transcription, reverse transcription, generating a double-stranded DNA, finding GC content of DNA string and subsection of DNA string, translation of mRNA into an amino acid sequence, calculating frequency/proportion of a particular amino acid from the amino acid sequence, generating 6 reading frames, extracting all possible protein from a given amino acid sequence, extracting all possible proteins from the 6 reading frames. 
This set of codes could be compiled in a class for easy usage and it can be used as a base for making any GUI for performing such tasks.
Possibilities are endless and there is always a chance of improvement.
