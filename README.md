# Bioinformaticts-with-Python
This repository has some basic bioinformatics activity/operations done in Python. Although, there are n number of offline and online tools doing these jobs but still, doing these jobs by own coding would give you a proper insight into how those available tools work at the coding level.  Don't just copy the codes, rather try to understand the logic behind it and more importantly try to make these codes even better.
